**Find Todos**

This is a short script (parseScript.js) that parses the directory where the script is executed to search for files that have at least 1 `TODO` keyword present.

The absolute path of the files are logged to the terminal.

**Getting Started**
```
git clone <repository link>
cd findTodos
npm install //installs related dependencies
```
**Tests**
```
npm run test
```
